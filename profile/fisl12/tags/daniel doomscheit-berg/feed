Meetings will have the anonimity of complaints made in the Internet as main focus, hence preserving the sources of information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel became a public person as he was the "face" of Wikileaks, together with Julian Assange for three years. After some differences, he decided to leave the project and today is being threatened by his old partner, who said he will sue him for sabotage. Author of the book "Inside Wikileaks", Domscheit-Berg brought to the public the structural problems of one of the most controversial organizations in the last few years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OpenLeaks was created to act responsibly in disclosure of material received via leaks, via sources who wish to remain protected n the process. Created in 2010, it uses colective intelligence to support sites who promote complaints, making the leak broader and, most important, reducing risk for those who wish to fight corruption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The structure of the organization relies on 12 employees from various origins, being publicly represented by Daniel himself and by the icelandic historian Hernert Snorrason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;fisl12 happens from June, 29 to July, 02, in the PUCRS Center of Events, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.
