Oona Castro, executive director of Overmundo Institute, spoke about the piracy-fighting system in Brazil and the rewrite of the brazilian Copyright Law. She mentioned the implications of copyright on educational resources, art production, access to culture and consumers rights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The survey "Media Piracy in Emerging Economies" carried on by the Fundação Getulio Vargas - FGV - Law, Rio de Janeiro in partnership with Overmundo Institute, showed that a pirate DVD in Brazil costs the same as a original DVD in the US. "The study shows that the battle against piracy will be won not by repression, but in the economic field, with the offer of products whose prices are compatible with people's income", explains Oona.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The speaker also shows data referring to piracy in the country, who have on scientific basis. "It is said that Brazil looses two million jobs a year with piracy. There is no single research that yields this number. Another very popular data is that Brazil looses R$ 30 billion a year in taxes due to piracy, but this is another bogus information. The problem is that these data get forwarded over and over without any questioning", she said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2011 17:00:45 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/piracy-is-debated-in-fisl12</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/piracy-is-debated-in-fisl12</guid></item></channel></rss>
