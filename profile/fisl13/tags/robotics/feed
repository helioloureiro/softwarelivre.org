&lt;p&gt;A bunch of people around electronic gear, wires, screws, wheels, monitors and tools. Suddenly, a remotely controlled penguin crosses the place, followed by someone driving a recycled metal vehicle while dodging robots built on spare parts and debris. That's the scenery known by those who's already attended a Free Technologies Festival, that happens at the Forum. This year you will be able to be part of this, by proposing activities to the official grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects and devices that use free hardware and software may be exhibited during the event. Candidates must get in touch by the email roboticalivre at softwarelivre dot org. It is important to send a brief description of the piece, as well as photos, videos and site, if there is one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Free Technologies Festival at fisl13 will gather those interested in digital culture, robotics and metarecycling for workshops, meetings and presentations. The main goal is to be a moment of gathering and networking of the robotics community and to strenghten the idea of a new model for production which values free knowledge as a fundamental basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2012 22:13:34 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/help-build-the-programme-for-the-free-technologies-festival</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/help-build-the-programme-for-the-free-technologies-festival</guid></item></channel></rss>
