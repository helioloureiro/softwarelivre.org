This year, registrations are open up to June, 20 and there will be 40 slots available, with workbench, four eletric power sources, four network  outlets (broadband) and chairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;To learn how to register, &lt;a href="/myprofile/fisl12/atracoes/grupos-de-usuarios"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the groups confirmed in this edition are Colméia, research in free software, from Santa Catarina, who already participated in other editions, and the female group Garotas CPBR. "This is the first time we participate in fisl, we're anxious and we expect to disclose our group, create new partnerships and share our ideas", said the coordinator Elaine Cecília Gatto. She also told the group, formed by 130 women, intends to present a proposal for a community event, focused in a PhD research from one of their participants, about women in IT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides participating in the room for Users Groups in fisl12, groups can also propose community events (CE). The CEs are proposed and organized by their own participants, aiming to conduct meetings and mini-events of communities, projects, entities and Users Groups, fostering integration between members and the free software commmunity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Registrations for Community Events are made through the &lt;a href="https://fisl.org.br/12/papers_ng/public/welcome"&gt;call for works&lt;/a&gt; system and are available up to May, 10. To carry out a successfull Community Event, get in touch with the respective community, set up subject, programme, activities, build a general map of what can be presented and how to attract public attention and pottential colaborators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
