The Round is aimed at gathering together companies that produce and hire Free Software based Information and Communication Technologies with emphasis in competence complementarity.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; RNC will create an environment for companies interested in buying/selling finished products; developing comercial partnerships that will enable expansion and consolidation of businesses; offer their competences in software development using free technologies, creating opportunity for new products, businesses or partnerships. At registration time, each company will declare whether it wishes to offer finished products and describe them briefly. If the company is willing to be hired for software development, it must point out what technologies it masters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The participants' profile is composed of companies that develop their products and services using free and/or open source technologies and wish to exhibit their portfolio in the event, or seek products, services and businesses partners. Companies participating as contractors may register to buy technologies already developed and services, among them software development or look for new partners for new businesses or products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The event will also host speeches and panels oriented towards that area. The Business and Competences Round will happen in July, 27 from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM at the PUCRS Center of Events. Registrations can be made at the &lt;a href="http://aplicativos.sebrae-rs.com.br/rodadasdenegocios"&gt;Sebrae-RS website&lt;/a&gt; up to July, 13.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2012 15:39:55 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/registrations-are-open-for-the-free-technologies-in-business-and-competences-round</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/registrations-are-open-for-the-free-technologies-in-business-and-competences-round</guid></item></channel></rss>
