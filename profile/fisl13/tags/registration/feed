&lt;p&gt;One of the classic parts in fisl is the presence of various &lt;strong&gt;Users Groups&lt;/strong&gt; who promote a huge exchange of knowledge. That's the time when participants gather around common interests and share novelties, besides getting to know those persons that they only have interacted with remotely. Good news is that registrations for "U.G.'s" are still open and available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selection will happen in the first days of July and the chosen groups to occupy the 40 slots will have an outstanding location in the event's exhibition hall. Requisites are: having more than 4 representatives in the event; availability and responsability for their area in the four days of the event; having contributions to the community; having a website and discussion list with info about the group for disclosure. Members have the right to two Participants registrations and tickets (able to attend speeches) and two exhibitors registrations and tickets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cissa Gatto is founder of the community &lt;strong&gt;#GarotasCPBR&lt;/strong&gt;, who attended for the first time last year. The Group had attendees from various Brazilian states, like Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Santa Catarina. That was the first time Elaine visited Porto Alegre, and the cold weather was very impressive to her! "I slept with almost all the warm clothing I had taken with me and only two blankets provided by the hotel. Showers were a big problem, in that freezing cold weather, but I had to face it!", she says. By the way, cold weather is always a big problem for those not living in South Brazil, and coming from other states. Don't forget to bring some warm clothing ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are encouraged to create your own group and participate in this big freedom party, register &lt;a href="/fisl13/grupos-de-usuarios/cadastro-de-grupos-de-usuarios"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In case you have doubts, send an email to gus at softwarelivre dot org.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2012 20:58:42 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/registrations-for-users-groups-still-open</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/registrations-for-users-groups-still-open</guid></item><item><title>Registrations to Users Groups are open</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/articles/0042/3244/gus-java.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: xx-small;"&gt;The Java-RS group was present at fisl10. (Photo: &lt;a href="http://www.rsjug.org/" title="RSJUG" target="_blank"&gt;RSJUG&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, fisl opens its exhibition hall to free software communities to show their work and interact live. The event offers a coworking structure, with 4 work seats, for up to 40 groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hall is meant to be like an exhibit. Groups bring their identification, banners, pets and flyers, and commit to leaving at least one representative to talk to the general public and other group´s colleagues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It´s a unique opportunity to be present in the largest FS community meeting in Latin America, sharing knowledge and strengthening the sharing activity that is our major asset. In the selection phase, the community´s relevance and number of users will be considered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UGs can now send their proposals to one of the 40 available slots, which, besides the slot, also provide two participant and two exhibitor´s credentials.&lt;br&gt;Learn more about the users groups registration &lt;a href="/fisl13/grupos-de-usuarios/users-groups"&gt;at this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2012 15:48:31 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/registrations-to-users-groups-are-open</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/registrations-to-users-groups-are-open</guid></item></channel></rss>
