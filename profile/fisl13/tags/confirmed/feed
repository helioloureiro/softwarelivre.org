Today, 15 years after it started, &lt;a href="http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/"&gt;dcraw&lt;/a&gt; became the basis in which other softwares build their compatibility with raw camera files. &lt;a href="http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/"&gt;dcraw&lt;/a&gt; was the missing piece of software to enable work on professional photography with free software.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The youngsters JB Kempf and Félix Kuhne come respectively from France and Germany to share their sucess experience of their project VideoLan Organization, a developers community which has VLC as its main asset.
