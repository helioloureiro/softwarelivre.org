&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The brazilian proverb "It is worth it to be a quiet wise man than a bad informed parrot" proved its value in these last days. Recently, the mass midia explored the attacks to government websites in different ways,&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt; mentioning even Wikileaks as a moving element to these actions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;This press' reaction and the perpexity of population could be expected, once the majority of the people not even know the distinction between hackers and crackers, and consider all of them as bandits or bad people that will steal our lives, and are prepared to be manipulated to some unprepared opinion formers. And with all these confused information spread through the mass media, an old and already very discussed topic came back: the Digital AI - 5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The digital AI - 5 is a project of the deputate Eduardo Azeredo (PSDB - MG) that have the goal of control the internet, with server spying rights as a way to " avoid the evil", as the pedophilia. The project is being conducted in a wrong way and it have arguments that cannot be supported, as example, that pedophilia could be internet's consequence, once it can be the way to propagate inappropriate materials. Therefore, "internet should be controlled". Thinking in this way, the State should previously bug the telephone of every person just because it is possible to threaten others with death by a phone call, or even so, the government should take off any knife from the restaurants, beceuse it could be a dangerous gun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;It is important that all citizens are acquainted with the topic, because it acts directly on the rights of each of us. Each citizen have to listen and form its own opinion with conscience. The last attacks are serious situations that envolves national information, but them cannot be used to promote a lw's project that supposes that we have to be controlled or inspectioned all the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The Science and Technology minister Aloizio Mercadante affirmed that the stat-owned websites invasion means that the government "needs to invest and prepare itself to have a defense structure more eficient and linked", not that this should be a reason to censorship or indiscriminate opression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
