Both "Feminino Livre" and "Garotas CPBR" groups deal with the subject of women in the TI work market and try to popularize tech-related activities among the female audience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Created in 2010, the "Garotas CPBR" has 130 members already, 10 of which will participate at fisl. "Besides exchanging experiences with other groups, we would like to put up a community event about female participation in this area, which is yet very much dominated by men", says the group coordinator, Elaine Cecília Gatto. The "Garotas CPBR" group have a blog where they discuss the dificulties and advances of women in the area, and publish tech knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Feminino Livre" began in fisl in 2010, idealized by women who work in the event's organization and felt the need of a more female look at certain aspects. "We also realized we could attract more women to technology and to fisl, by worrying about different and complementary aspects", says one of the group's coordinators, Paloma Costa. According to her, research points that the IT sector is only 12.56% female. "It's a booming market with an exponential  demand every year for professionals, and missing not only women, but qualified people, so it is important that more women seek jobs in the field", she says. The idea turned into a Workgroup at fisl, that, as of last year, proposes female speeches, among other activities. The "Feminino Livre" group also maitains a colaborative website and gathers often, to discuss actions and TI event participation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The registrations for Users Groups are up to June, 20. During the event each group will have its own slot with a desk, chairs, to display their materials, present their work and share experiences.
