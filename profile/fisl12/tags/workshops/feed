The robotics workshop, administered by the teacher Danilo Rodrigues César (UFBA), happens in a laboratory built inside of fisl with a huge diversity of recycling materials. The goal is to introduce concepts about free robotics to the audience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the metarecycling  workshop is an activity inspirated in the Free Robotics olimpics, in art&amp;amp;technology, in prototyping, in the remix, in the hacker culture, and in the free software. The goal is to create a huge diversity of shapes and instruments trough disposable and recyclable electronic equipment. It is a space to the people meet each other and to formulate projects together, providing the experience exchange.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The workshops will happen during the four days of fisl12. The slots are limitated and the registration can be realized by the e-mail: &lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;roboticalivre in softwarelivre.org or at the event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2011 16:22:38 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/workshops-about-robotics-attract-public</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/workshops-about-robotics-attract-public</guid></item><item><title>Workshops</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hands-on learning in #fisl12&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;If you are thinking of attending some of the workshops at fisl, this text is for you! Know exactly what to expect from these activities and enjoy them as much as possible with no surprises!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a rule, workshops need no pre-registration*: you save your seat just by arriving early and getting in the line. Workshops happen in rooms 701 and 702 in building 40, and all workshops are 50 people max capacity (and all of them last more than one session). Passwords will be distributed 15 minutes before each one. Good to remember that you will learn a lot, but workshops provide no certificate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notice that to enjoy the workshops you have to bring your laptop and have the necessary programs already installed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;English fluency may be a pre-requisite for some of the workshops. No, we won't test your english for a seat, but if you are are unable to follow the activity, you'll end up losing interest and preventing some one else from attending.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the case also with requisites for software and hardware specific knowledge, that some workshops demand. To learn what requisites exist, click in the box for the workshop in the event's programme grid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get to know the workshops available to the Free Software community in 2011 visiting our programme &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://fisl.org.br/12/papers_ng/public/fast_grid?event_id=1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Exception is the Debian GNU/Linux Essentials for women &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;workshop &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; - &lt;a href="/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/free-systems-administration-course-for-girls-to-happen-during-fisl12"&gt;more details here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2011 21:44:23 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/workshops</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/workshops</guid></item></channel></rss>
