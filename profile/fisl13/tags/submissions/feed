To submit your proposal, &lt;a href="http://fisl.org.br/13/papers_ng/public/welcome"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;. Activities will be organized in the following thematic zones: Admin, Development, Desktop, Emerging Issues, Education, Ecosystem, Workshops and Community Meetings. The first call for the approved submissions is planned for May, 25.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Just like in fisl12, the best proposals will be selected by the community, which will soon receive an email with a code for evaluation. In this system, called Swiss Tournament, each evaluator will see pairs of proposals, one is to be chosen. This process, iterated many times among users, allows for the best proposals to outstand. Besides the participants and speakers who applied this year and in the previous, also the associates to ASL will join the &lt;br&gt;process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year, the system received around 670 submissions of activities proposals. This initiative wishes to integrate the users community and programmers in building the event´s programme grid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doubts may be sent to programafisl13@softwarelivre.org.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2012 16:32:57 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/deadline-for-proposals-submission-to-fisl13-was-postponed</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/deadline-for-proposals-submission-to-fisl13-was-postponed</guid></item></channel></rss>
