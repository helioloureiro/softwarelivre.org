Also, the event aims on gathering signatures for the Open Networks of Latin America, written at the previous meeting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In March 2011, the Balneário de Iporá, in Uruguay, was the stage for the Second Regional Open Networks Journey, which was attended by the open networks research group of Associação Software Livre.Org (ASL). In this meeting, was defined as the technical basis the Wireless Network for Development World (wndw.net) and the Wireless Common Licence (WCL) used by the Guifi.net network as the compatible license that defines and protect legally the open networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who can participate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between the open networks groups are the system administrators, community representatives, telecommunications engineers, programmers, entrepreneurs, lawyers and other people interested in helping to build open networks in their communities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The Open Networks or Mesh Networks generally operate based on principles of collaborative communities, working with the goal of having a data network built and run by its own users and open to the community. Each network has its peculiarities and techniques of management, in accordance with the goals of each group. In some cases, only providing local services and exchange data between the connected nodes, while in other cases add up to this task, the Internet access to get available to the population open and free of cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The network is a metropolitan city area and it’s limited to where it works, offering an alternative way of communication, free and self-managed, which aims to democratize access to information and promote the use of technology and Opensource software.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
