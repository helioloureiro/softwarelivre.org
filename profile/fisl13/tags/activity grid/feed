The free slots are being occupied as speakers confirm their participation at the schedule offered. Because of that, changes can happen up to the event´s first day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speeches were selected by participants and proponents of this edition and the last one, using a "swiss tournament" tool. In this method, each evaluator receives pairs of proposals, and must choose one. This process, repeated many times among users, allowed for the best proposals to appear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activities will be organized in the following thematic zones: Admin, Development, Desktop, Emerging Topics, Education, Ecosystem, Workshops and Community Meetings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jul 2012 18:09:13 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/the-activity-grid-is-begining-to-be-built</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/the-activity-grid-is-begining-to-be-built</guid></item></channel></rss>
