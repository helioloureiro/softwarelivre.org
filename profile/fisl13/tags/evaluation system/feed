The process is twofold: the first part is running now, up to May, 31, when ASL.Org associates, activities proponents and participants already registered vote; the second is from June, 1st to 5, when last year´s proponents and participants vote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The evaluation system works as a "swiss tournament", where each evaluator receives pairs of proposals and must choose one. This process, repeated many times among users, allows for the best proposals to stand out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activities are organized in the following thematic zones: Admin, Development, Desktop, Emerging Topics, Education, Ecosystem, Workshops and Community Meetings. First call for the approved works will happen up to June, 18, and the second is June, 25.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2012 17:29:45 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/evaluation-of-activities-proposals-has-started</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/evaluation-of-activities-proposals-has-started</guid></item></channel></rss>
