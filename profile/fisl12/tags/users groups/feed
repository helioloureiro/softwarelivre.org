&lt;p style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The search by Users Groups interested in attending fisl was so intense that the available 40 positions were all taken a few weeks prior to the event. Just like previous editions, fisl12 opens up room for users groups from the most diverse languages, technologies, operating systems and technological trends related to free software.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Users Groups have, at fisl, adequate room for experience sharing and also an opportunity to show their work.

"This is the first time we participate in fisl, we're anxious and we expect to disclose our group, create new partnerships and share our ideas", said the coordinator Elaine Cecília Gatto.

The CEs are proposed and organized by their own participants, aiming to conduct meetings and mini-events of communities, projects, entities and Users Groups, fostering integration between members and the free software commmunity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Registrations for Community Events are made through the &lt;a href="https://fisl.org.br/12/papers_ng/public/welcome"&gt;call for works&lt;/a&gt; system and are available up to May, 10.
