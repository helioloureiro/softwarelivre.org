Come up with subject, content, activities, make a general list of what could be presented and how can the public attention and potential colaborators be atracted to it. It is important that each community meeting have their own internet page so we can reference it in fisl12 official page, and that the organizing community be autonomous to update the information about its own event.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Information &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Organizing Committee determined a specific track for the CEs with rooms for an average of 70 people each.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each community event shall be lead by three coordinators, previously registered in the Lecturer's System and referenced in the CE's proposal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The determined duration is 1 or 2 sessions of 50 minutes, for each CE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Event Program&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is mandatory that each community event contain:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Lightning talks - mini-lectures of 5-10 minutes with the colaborations of their participants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Discussion/Questions - interaction with questions and final talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Check the people confirmed and their availability to participate in the program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more elaborated the proposal,  rich and diversified program, the more people will be interested to join, bringing more visibility to your event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to propose a community event?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subscriptions are made through the &lt;a href="https://fisl.org.br/12/papers_ng/public/welcome"&gt;Call for Works&lt;/a&gt; system.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is very important to be aware that:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•  The community events may last no more than 2 sessions, being 1 session the standard time (for more than 1 session, please specify and justify in your proposal, for committee evaluation) &lt;br&gt;•  We ask everybody to try to fit their events in 1 session so we can contemplate all the subscribed people. We rely on everybody's colaboration in order to include all interested people.&lt;br&gt;• Because community events are integrated to the main event's grid, there is no much schedule flexibility. We'll try, as much as possible, to adequate the grid to include all the registered events. If such adjustments are possible, we'll contact the responsible people, according to registration order.&lt;br&gt;• All the subscriptions will be evaluated by the organizing committee and the approved ones will be contacted.&lt;br&gt;• The events that have a community and/or a users group will be prioritized.&lt;br&gt;•  Community Events designed to popularise projects and/or softwares will not be accepted. In these cases, the adequate track shall be used.&lt;br&gt;• Events not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;directly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;connected to free software will be autommatically rejected. The organizing team reserves the right to accept only the events deemed relevant to the Forum.&lt;br&gt;• A CE coordinator can coordinate one, and only one, community event at fisl12.&lt;br&gt;• The event coordinators shall be the authors of the proposal.&lt;br&gt;• Changes of event coordinators after the end of subscription period will not be accepted.&lt;br&gt;• The approved authors will be contacted soon after the end of subscription period.&lt;br&gt;• It is essential that you send the complete program for the event and its abstract so we can publish it in the main grid.&lt;br&gt;• Disclosure of time, room and date of the event in websites and blogs is paramount for the success of your event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
