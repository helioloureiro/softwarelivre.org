&lt;p&gt;And here we are, our &lt;strong&gt;13th&lt;/strong&gt; edition! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 13 years, the International Free Software Forum - fisl has grown and matured as the most significant Free Software (and culture!) meeting in Latin America. Worldwide famous, fisl is the result of work, collaboration and involvement of thousands of people who believe in Free Software and in the strength of the community, both in Brazil and abroad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every year, Porto Alegre becomes the meeting point of a crowd full of ideas, novelties and motivations, who believe that only through free knowledge can the human being live in community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join fisl, be it the first time or another one. Get involved, colaborate, teach and learn. Support the efforts of a community that believes in the power of sharing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be aware of the new stuff in the website, which will be updated constantly, up to July. Register yourself and participate! fisl13 happens from 25 to 28, July 2012, at the PUC Center of Events, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be welcome!&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Apr 2012 14:05:35 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/about-the-event</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/about-the-event</guid></item></channel></rss>
