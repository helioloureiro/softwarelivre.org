&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Friends Thomas Petry, Miguel Scott and Steff Vasem posing with John Maddog during #fisl12, 2011.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We contacted the first participant to have his registration confirmed for #fisl13. Miguel Mendes Scott is 16 years old and is both a high school and a tech school student in Ivoti, a city in the inner state of Rio Grande do Sul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miguel, who first heard of fisl last year, because of a school promotion, hushed to take advantage from the discounted registrations for students - &lt;a href="http://fisl.org.br/13/greve/" title="INSCREVA-SE JÁ!" target="_blank"&gt;R$ 100,00 up to apr/30, and R$ 50,00 for students&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He says his participation in the event was paramount in his formation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I found it real cool and registered to go to #fisl13. I attended last year knowing very little about Free Software, but when I returned my idea was just so different. My knowledge was greater, and so was my interest."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He says at fisl he met an ideology he shared, the one of free and shared knowledge, and ever since Free Software has become a growing interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"After the event, I went after other subjects, and even found out that I was a Free Software user and advocated - and I still do - what many people think, in respect to Free Software and LINUX."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the subjects that appeal to Miguel are security, general programming - "more specifically C#, Java, Python, Perl, Ruby, HTML5" - besides subjects typical of systems admins, like configuration and command line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miguel and his friends are returning to #fisl13 this year to keep learning and integrating themselves to the community. And he has already demanded speeches and themes he wants to learn more about: "security, general programming, linux programming for android and cloud hosting".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of Miguel´s suggestions &lt;a href="/fisl13/chamada-de-trabalhos" title="Sobre a chamada de trabalhos" target="_blank"&gt;are already satisfied in the programme´s tracks&lt;/a&gt;. The others were sent to the Programme Workgroup, a group that manages the preparation of the event´s agenda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miguel will certainly learn a lot again. And how about you discovering Free software as well? :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Apr 2012 16:55:41 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/16-years-old-student-is-the-first-to-be-confirmed-as-a-participant-in-fisl13</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/16-years-old-student-is-the-first-to-be-confirmed-as-a-participant-in-fisl13</guid></item></channel></rss>
