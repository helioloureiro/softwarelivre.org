Authentication ends up being one alternative to ensure credibility to transferred data and the "key" is the identification of each person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To improve the infra-structure and strenghten the Web of Trust, a OpenPGP key signing party will happen in July, 1st, during the 12th International Free Software Forum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The process is about users signing each other's keys, stablishing a pact, publicly available for everybody's queries. This way, users present in the records of a given member that signs another person's key, even not knowing themselves personally, will be part of the same web of credibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Keys are a cryptographic mechanism formed by a series of math formulas aiming to cypher and decypher information. To warrant that the key is indeed yours is a task for a virtual entity known as Web of Trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to participate, you must:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Send your key to server ksp.softwarelivre.org up to 10 PM, June, 28.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Verify if the key is correctly in place, by trying to send again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Wait for the list of participating keys with the hashes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-size: small;"&gt;- Print the list and compute yourself the hashes, marking in the right place if they match.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Bring to the party two id documents with photo (at least one of them emitted by a government), copy of your key's fingerprint, the printed list and a pen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For complete information, visit &lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="/fisl12/assinatura-de-chaves"&gt;Key Signing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2011 22:11:28 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/key-signing-party-to-take-place-july-1st-during-fisl12</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/key-signing-party-to-take-place-july-1st-during-fisl12</guid></item></channel></rss>
