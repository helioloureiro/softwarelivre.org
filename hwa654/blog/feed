The company was established in 2000 and is headquartered in Xi'an, China, which is the new “Belt and Road” and the starting point of the old Silk Road. Through the integration of various metal materials, &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/"&gt;LINKUN®&lt;/a&gt; has become one of the largest metal supermarkets, which can provide various Special Metal Materials manufactured in China and imported to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we also have a variety of Copper Alloys products. &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/uns-c68700"&gt;Uns C68700&lt;/a&gt; has excellent corrosion resistance and excellent cold workability, which can be used for forming and bending. &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/uns-c70600"&gt;Uns C70600&lt;/a&gt; has excellent impact resistance. It also has excellent corrosion resistance. This alloy is suitable for marine condenser tube installation instead of aluminum brass, especially where higher water speeds are encountered. They are both suitable for condensers, evaporators and heat exchanger tubes; distillation tubes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a professional steel pipe manufacturer, we also provide various line pipes, including multiple API 5L pipes. API 5L pipe line is a transportation method used to transport oil, water and natural gas to the oil and gas industry company through pipeline. Our &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/x52-line-pipe"&gt;X52 Line Pipe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/x56-line-pipe"&gt;X56 Line Pipe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/x60-line-pipe"&gt;X60 Line Pipe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/x70-line-pipe"&gt;X70 Line Pipe&lt;/a&gt; are the tools used for their transportation. The yield strength of the pipe is specified by the number following the X in the material grade name (in kilograms per square inch, or KSI). So, for example, the minimum yield strength of API 5L X70 pipes is 70 KSI. In addition, we also supply products that meet ASTM A333 pipeline grade specifications. Our &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/a333-grade-6-pipe"&gt;A333 Grade 6 Pipe&lt;/a&gt; can provide customers with pipes of different sizes, specifications, grade materials and shapes at market leading prices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also supply duplex stainless steel. This type of steel has the characteristics of both austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. Our &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/uns-s31803-sheet"&gt;Uns S31803 Sheet&lt;/a&gt; has excellent corrosion resistance to seawater and most concentrations of sulfuric acid. &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/uns-s32750-sheet"&gt;Uns S32750 Sheet&lt;/a&gt; is very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/uns-s32760-plate"&gt;Uns S32760 Plate&lt;/a&gt;, but the chemical composition is slightly different. Typical applications of our duplex stainless steel includes pipes, pumps, valves, flanges, etc. They are also widely used in the brewing, power generation, oil and gas, and chemical engineering industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are committed to Stainless Steels Products for many years. 304 and 316 stainless steels are the two most commonly used stainless steels. The main difference between 316 and 304 in chemical composition is that 316 contains Mo. &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/316-stainless-steel-plate"&gt;316 Stainless Steel Plate&lt;/a&gt; is added with 2% molybdenum to better resist local corrosion caused by acids and chloride ions than 304 in high temperature environments. &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/316l-stainless-steel-pipe"&gt;316L stainless steel pipe&lt;/a&gt; is a low carbon alloy of 316 and is not sensitized (grain boundary carbide precipitation). Therefore, it is widely used for heavy welding parts. &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/316ti-stainless-steel"&gt;316ti stainless steel&lt;/a&gt; uses a titanium-stabilized version of 316 molybdenum-containing austenitic stainless steel. It has high creep, stress fracture and tensile strength at high temperatures. &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/347-stainless-steel"&gt;347 Stainless Steel&lt;/a&gt; is an austenitic stainless steel, stabilized by the addition of cobalt (plus tantalum), and has good corrosion and oxidation resistance and good creep strength. Type 347 is ideally suited for aircraft collector rings and exhaust manifolds, expansion joints and high temperature chemical process equipment. &lt;a href="https://www.lksteelpipe.com/321-stainless-steel-sheet"&gt;321 Stainless Steel Sheet&lt;/a&gt; is made of a very stable stainless steel. When the temperature reaches 800-1500 ° F (427-816 ° C) and chromium carbide precipitates, it can still maintain good resistance to intergranular corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;
