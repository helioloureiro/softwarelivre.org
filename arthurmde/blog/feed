Almost two years later it came across my radar and I asked via Twitter if WhiteSource was interested in getting feedback on the blog, since it contained errata. They never replied and it fell off my radar. Last […]&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 22:05:19 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/whitesource-on-open-source-vulnerability-databases-errata</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/whitesource-on-open-source-vulnerability-databases-errata</guid></item><item><title>That Vulnerability is “Theoretical”!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, while writing a draft of a different blog, I made reference to and said “we’re well aware of the pitfalls around calling a vulnerability ‘theoretical’“! I wanted to link off to what I was referencing, a case where security researchers found a vulnerability in a big vendor’s products and were told […]&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 22:05:18 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/that-vulnerability-is-theoretical</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/that-vulnerability-is-theoretical</guid></item><item><title>Your yearly reminder to post to Full-Disclosure, not Bugtraq</title><description>&lt;p&gt;This has been a long-recognized and proven thing, but every year we run into more glaring examples. SecurityFocus, who runs the BID database, which is part of Symantec’s DeepSight offering, routinely uses submissions to the Bugtraq mail list to seed their commercial database, sometimes days before approving the post. This means subscribers who use Bugtraq […]&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 22:05:18 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/your-yearly-reminder-to-post-to-full-disclosure-not-bugtraq</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/your-yearly-reminder-to-post-to-full-disclosure-not-bugtraq</guid></item><item><title>The Duality of Expertise: Microsoft</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The notion of expertise in any field is fascinating. It crosses so many aspects of humans and our perception. For example, two people in the same discipline, each with the highest honors academic can grant, can still have very different expertise within that field. Society and science have advanced so we don’t have just have […]&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 22:05:18 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/the-duality-of-expertise-microsoft</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/the-duality-of-expertise-microsoft</guid></item><item><title>Let’s X-ray SCMagazine…</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Hopefully a really quick blog, but a section of a news article titled “Hackers are having a field day with stolen credentials” by Amol Sarwate, Qualys’ Director of Vulnerability Labs, published in SC Magazine caught my attention. The section: Let’s X-ray the attack methods Typically, hackers “fingerprint” websites’ underlying software, such as their blog content […]&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 22:05:18 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/lets-x-ray-scmagazine</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/lets-x-ray-scmagazine</guid></item><item><title>I do not think it means what you think it means…</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Sometime in the past day or so, CVE-2016-10001 was publicly disclosed, and possibly a duplicate. Regardless, CVE-2016-10002 is also now public and legitimate. Tonight, I Tweeted that the presence of those IDs doesn’t mean what many will think it means. I say that based on the past experience, both historical and more recent.

I lost track of time and forgot to finish it off then.

Spanning 10 pages, likely for extra ad revenue, the sub-title reads: Keeping up with the latest vulnerabilities — especially in the context of the latest threats — can be a real challenge. One would hope this article would […]&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 22:05:17 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/rebuttal-dark-readings-9-sources-for-tracking-new-vulnerabilities</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/rebuttal-dark-readings-9-sources-for-tracking-new-vulnerabilities</guid></item><item><title>Response to Kenna Security’s Explanation of the DBIR Vulnerability Mess</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Michael Roytman of Kenna Security wrote a blog with more details about the vulnerability section of the Verizon DBIR report, partially in response to my last blog here questioning how some of the data was generated and the conclusions put forth. The one real criticism I will note, is that Roytman’s blog […]&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 22:05:17 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/response-to-kenna-securitys-explanation-of-the-dbir-vulnerability-mess</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/arthurmde/blog/response-to-kenna-securitys-explanation-of-the-dbir-vulnerability-mess</guid></item><item><title>A Note on the Verizon DBIR 2016 Vulnerabilities Claims</title><description>&lt;p&gt;[Updated 4/28/2016] Verizon released their yearly Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) and it wasn’t too long before I started getting asked about their “Vulnerabilities” section (page 13). After bringing up some highly questionable points about last year’s report regarding vulnerabilities, several people felt that the report did not stand up to scrutiny.
