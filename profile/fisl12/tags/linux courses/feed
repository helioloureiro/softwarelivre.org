&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The fisl12 participants who register up to May, 15 will be eligible to win two 4Linux courses: Linux Essentials and Linux System Administration. The courses selection are available to every registered participant up to that date. The courses may be taken either presentially or remotely, using the internet. Both are 40 hour long, with options for afternoons or evening courses, for those who choose the presential alternative. The courses are aimed at training to be a Servers Administrator and Linux Network Admin, and offer basis for the LPI certification test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Linux Essentials introduces the student to the GNU/Linux universe, presenting the Free Software Philosophy, enabling to interact adequately with the Linux Operating System. The training emphasizes organization, development and  functionality of the Linux Operating System and its main tools. The student then acquires a solid base to broaden his/her knowledge in Linux, and then specialize further, with other courses. 4Linux uses the Debian distribution, but the student will be trained to work with the Red Hat distribution, since over the course the main differences between distros are also enphasized. Even for those who already are Linux users, and have some experience with Linux, this course helps to organize and mature knowledge, empowering and facilitating future development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Linux System Administration covers GNU/Linux system concepts from installation of the operating system with dpkg and RPM packages up to kernel compilation, including system services configuration such as SSH, Cups, NTP and Rsyslog. Practical classes happen in completely structured Linux labs for the application of concepts and tests in Linux and is the only one to cover Wireless technology in a Linux course - where students leran how to deploy a wifi network and WEP criptography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Proceed with your registration and think positive to be elected! fisl12 happens from June, 29 to July, 2 in the PUCRS Center of Events, Porto Alegre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2011 16:52:01 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/fisl12-will-draw-4linux-course-tickets-between-fisl12-participants</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/fisl12-will-draw-4linux-course-tickets-between-fisl12-participants</guid></item></channel></rss>
