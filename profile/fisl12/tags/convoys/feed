In order to boost transportation to fisl, many opt to go by convoys. The main reason for convoys to exist is to enable the presence of groups and to allow registrations with discount.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To setup a convoy, it is necessary at least six people to get together, with one of them as a leader. The responsible for the convoy shall register it in the event and make sure participants pay their registration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The leader is exempt from the registration tax, as long as at least five other participants have made their registration, in due deadline. If less people registered and paid, the leader does not get exempt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the second time the IT Law specialist Samuel Cersosimo goes to fisl through convoys. He, the leader of the convoy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; Viasdefato.com, from Salvador (BA), hopes to network both academically and professionally, besides learning more about free software tools. "I hope fisl12 will be as positive as my last time", he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Bernardo Diego Gonzalez lives in Buenos Aires and it is the third time he participates at fisl. To him, the exchange of information between free software communities in Latin America is really important, for the debate of culture and technology matters. "Distance is not a problem, when you are certain the event will overcome all your expectations. That was what happened every time I've been to fisl".&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;SERVICE:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Doubts: caravanasfisl12@softwarelivre.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Convoys registrations: http://fisl.org.br/12/greve/caravan/intro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2011 12:03:48 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/there-are-now-80-confirmed-fisl12-convoys</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/there-are-now-80-confirmed-fisl12-convoys</guid></item><item><title>Take advantage of discounted registrations until this Sunday!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The deadline for registrations to fisl12 within the first batch of discounts is this sunday, May, 1st.
