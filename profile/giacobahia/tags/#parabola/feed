&lt;p&gt;Parabola &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt;/Linux is a full featured general-purpose distribution that&amp;#8217;s committed to only including free software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parabola strives to keep its packaging and management tools as simple as possible, so that users have plenty of flexibility to install and configure the system to their liking. It&amp;#8217;s based on Arch, and provides instructions for current Arch users to migrate to Parabola and remove any nonfree software they might have installed. A small team of hackers has come together to build and maintain the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are now nine different distributions included on our list. If you haven&amp;#8217;t already made the switch, check it out—with plenty of choices available, there&amp;#8217;s sure to be one that suits your needs and tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the distributions follow the Free System Distribution Guidelines, which spell out a commitment to ensure that the distribution only ever includes or recommends free software. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of free software out there, and sometimes mistakes slip through the cracks. If you find nonfree software in one of these distributions, you can report it as a bug. Once the report is confirmed, we&amp;#8217;ll send you a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt; Buck as a token of our appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2011 13:46:48 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/giacobahia/blog/parabola-a-cacula</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/giacobahia/blog/parabola-a-cacula</guid></item></channel></rss>
