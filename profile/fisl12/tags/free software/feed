The robotics workshop, administered by the teacher Danilo Rodrigues César (UFBA), happens in a laboratory built inside of fisl with a huge diversity of recycling materials. The goal is to introduce concepts about free robotics to the audience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the metarecycling  workshop is an activity inspirated in the Free Robotics olimpics, in art&amp;amp;technology, in prototyping, in the remix, in the hacker culture, and in the free software. The goal is to create a huge diversity of shapes and instruments trough disposable and recyclable electronic equipment. It is a space to the people meet each other and to formulate projects together, providing the experience exchange.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The workshops will happen during the four days of fisl12. The slots are limitated and the registration can be realized by the e-mail: &lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;roboticalivre in softwarelivre.org or at the event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2011 16:22:38 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/workshops-about-robotics-attract-public</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/workshops-about-robotics-attract-public</guid></item><item><title>Release your book during fisl</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/articles/0033/2100/fisl11.jpg1308321090" height="188" alt="Fisl11" style="float: left; margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px; margin-left: 6px; margin-right: 6px;" width="283"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
