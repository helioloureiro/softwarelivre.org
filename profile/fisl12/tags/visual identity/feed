The online vote amongst Associação Software Livre.Org (ASL) partners resulted in the selection of art proposed by Rafael Greque, who received a prize of BRL 2,000 and free enrollment at fisl12.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greque’s idea was to represent freedom with the layout and font size in the phrases that equally share space surrounding the fisl logo. In all, 18 proposals for the visual identity were selected to participate. Among some extremely elaborated art, with a range of elements and colors, it was the simplicity and objectivity of Rafael’s idea that came out on top. Congratulations to him and all those who took part in the contest!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2011 15:50:38 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/visual-identity-for-fisl12-selected-through-public-contest</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12/fisl12/noticias/visual-identity-for-fisl12-selected-through-public-contest</guid></item></channel></rss>
