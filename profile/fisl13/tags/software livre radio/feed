If you have good advice, please don´t forget to let us know at radio at softwarelivre dot org.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;tip: a great place to mine is the &lt;a href="http://www.jamendo.com"&gt;Jamendo&lt;/a&gt; website where bands place their music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;About the Software Livre Radio&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Software Livre Radio went on air in june, 19, 2009, at night in a joint operation between volunteers from Porto Alegre (RS), São Carlos (SP) and Denver (USA). Currently it is on air 24 hours a day broadcasting free and independent music, news from the tech world, interviews and the complete coverage of the International Free Software Forum, which happens every year at Porto Alegre, besides other national and international tech events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole operation and content generation infra-structure works exclusively with free formats and the Radio prioritizes music released under CC, from independent labels, from bands and artists who believe in collaborative production and in the free distribution of music over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jul 2012 12:03:38 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/software-livre-radio-will-renew-its-music-archive</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/software-livre-radio-will-renew-its-music-archive</guid></item></channel></rss>
