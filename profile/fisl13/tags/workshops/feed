The previous floating windows remains the default, but you can switch between them and have this config saved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Version 2.8 also allows dialogs docked to multiple columns. To create a new column, simply drag and release a dialog in the vertical edges of a window. That's an interesting feature for a multi-monitor configuration, where one monitor keeps all the dialogs, and the other one keeps all the images.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GIMP 2,8 brings a new concept in file export. Saving and exporting files are now clearly separated operations. Saving a file can only be done in xcf format (GMIP's native). To generate files in other formats, you use the Export function, in the File menu. This distinction makes it clear the preservation of all image information, when Save is used. There are some optimizations for alternative workflows, such as opening a jpg, working quickly in it and then exporting to the same file. This modification allowed to get rid of all the annoying dialogs about "flattening an image", when saving in formats that can't handle layers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Image layers get a new feature: they now can be grouped in groups of layers, as in a tree structure. For complex works, the previous "flat" structure was very limiting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Text edition now is made directly in the image, instead of a separate window. All the text attributes - position, font, size, alignment - will be able to be edited in this way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the tools drawings were ported to Cairo, for smooth and modern graphics, worthy of the users' expectations. All the plugins - except for a few - were also ported to Cairo. Additionally, tools now use a progress indicator right in the screen, instead of the one in the status bar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As usual, GIMP can be found in its &lt;a href="http://www.gimp.org"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="http://www.gimp.org/release-notes/gimp-2.8.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are Release Notes for version 2.8. Source-code download can be made in &lt;a href="http://www.gimp.org/downloads/"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. To obtain a binary package for your distribution, wait a couple days, since this release is quite new (May, 3, 2012).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="/razgriz"&gt;Guilherme Razgriz&lt;/a&gt;, Executive Director of &lt;a href="http://www.crialivre.com.br"&gt;Cria Livre&lt;/a&gt;, a School for Graphic Computing with Free Software, and active participant of the community, told us he's eager to know their student's reactions about the new interface (but personally, he'll just continue with the traditional one :). He also said he'll bring activities based in the GIMP to #fisl13:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Yes, I'm planning to bring several activities involving GIMP, but everything will depend on whether they'll be approved, and if I'll be able to spare some budget for the travel, apart all that, yes I do plan to do everything in the new GIMP!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every year, the area of graphic arts and multimedia are always well represented at fisl. In fisl12 there were speeches and workshops based on GIMP. There were also activities with Inkscape and Blender 3D. To check out this year's programme, stay tuned to the &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="/fisl13/call-for-works"&gt;Call for Works&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 May 2012 22:01:40 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/gimp-project-releases-stable-version-2.8</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/noticias/gimp-project-releases-stable-version-2.8</guid></item><item><title>Workshops - Real learning (and teaching!) at #fisl13</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Do we have workshops this year?! Oh, yes, you bet!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Workshops are a reserved environment to learn "hands on", as it is said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year you can attend workshops and also &lt;strong&gt;offer a workshop&lt;/strong&gt;! Yes, because we all have something we know a lot and could share with the community. Knowledge is one of the feww things that increase when we share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To propose a workshop, you should submit your proposal through the &lt;a href="http://fisl.org.br/13/papers_ng/public/welcome"&gt;Papers system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Workshops will be chosen, in case there´s more proposals than available rooms, by the Programme Workgroup, after an evaluation of which ones can be more relevant to the community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff6600;"&gt;Important: Workshop proposals will be accepted up to May/25.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, what if I just want to attend one workshop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="/articles/0041/6915/mg-3318.jpg" height="318" alt="" width="450"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It´s too early to choose which workshops you want to participate - we are still receiving proposals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here´s what you might be sure about them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long it takes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each round of workshops lasts 3 hours (#hint: toilet pitstops before!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I register myself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There´s no previous registration. Just get there early and save your seat, there will be 50 available seats in each room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is it going to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At rooms 614 and 615 from building 40 at PUC-RS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need to bring something?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, a laptop is fine (preferably).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When workshops are disclosed, be aware of the other pre-requisites: some will demand additional previous knowledge, others will demand that you install some softwares, or it is still possible that workshops are carried in english or spanish, in which case you must be profficient in these languages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;It is important to remember  you will learn a lot, but workshops provide no certificate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;To learn about pre-requisites, just click the corresponding box in the programme, but only when we have disclosed it, right?! ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Apr 2012 15:10:38 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/oficinas/workshops-real-learning-and-teaching-at-fisl13</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl13/oficinas/workshops-real-learning-and-teaching-at-fisl13</guid></item></channel></rss>
