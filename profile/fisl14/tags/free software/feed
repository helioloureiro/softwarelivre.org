&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought about producing a disc usaing exclusively Free Software? Musician André de Marco decided to face the challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his speech he explained how he recorded his independent disc completely in Free Software. The whole process took 4 years. He composed the songs, created a home studio, recorded all the instruments separately, sang, and made all remastering and editing using the Free Software &lt;a href="http://ardour.org/" target="_blank"&gt;“Ardour”&lt;/a&gt;, a free DAW licensed by the GPL, that allows the editing of digital professional audio. "It is hard for people to give credit to something that is non-mainstream. You have to hold on to it and believe it is going to work ok. Many people who discredited the whole idea were impressed by the final result", says DeMarco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wanna know how it has turned out?

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;During the third evening of fisl14, one of the most awaited speeches of the event took place:  &lt;em&gt;Livre Software and other essentials for computing freedom&lt;/em&gt;, with  Richard Stallman. Founder of Free Software Foundation, Stallman is a programmer, hacker and an influential politic activist of freedom of technology and information. He is the author of the GNU GPL license, the world's most used free license, that consolidated the concept of copyleft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Stallman, activism for Free Software is a mateer of ethics, society and politics. "Or users control their programs, or programs control users, but both ways can't happen". The activist stressed the importance of sharing: "We need much more than individual control, we need collective control", he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stallman compares proprietary softwares to colonial system, in which the population is deprived of its right to freedom and is dominated by big corporations. His main goal is the "liberation of cyberspace", condition in which users can legally modify, copy and distribute any material through the net.&lt;br style="text-align: justify;"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="/articles/0127/7449/stallman-2.jpg" alt="" width="600"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Zero Hora Newspaper interviewed him, who also answered some of these questions. Check out below; the whole interview is in this saturday issue of Zero Hora (Jul/06).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do governments want to know everything about people?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stallman – Because they can catch any whistleblower. They don't want us to know what's happening. United States have already shown that they want to hunt down and chase any whistleblower they can at any cost. The surveillance we have at the US today is incompatible with the human rights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you see the use of these tools to organize protests against govenrments?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stallman – It's ironical, given how horrible Facebook is. Facebook is a monstruous tool for surveillance. I beg you not to use Facebook. I never used it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network collaboration, technological independence, digital speech, distance learning, creativity and autonomy are some of the subjects that routinely make their way into the public schools in the Porto Alegre county.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During some of the workshops, a group of teachers presented their well succeeded experiences with Free Software. "I'm not a Free Software expert, but I'm always looking to learn more". Students help me a lot, because they usually find the answers quickly", says one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite some difficulties, use of Free Software in schools has enabled collaborative construction of knowledge and development of authorship, creation and critical thinking, teachers say.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2013 11:15:18 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl14/blog/county-schools-introduce-their-experiences-with-free-software-in-the-paulo-freire-room</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl14/blog/county-schools-introduce-their-experiences-with-free-software-in-the-paulo-freire-room</guid></item><item><title>"The teacher has to have a hacker way of being", says a speaker during fisl14</title><description>&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;img src="/articles/0127/6132/pretto.jpg" alt="" width="600"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Professor Nelson de Luca Pretto, from UFBA, spoke about education, innovation and information sharing at the class, in the speech  &lt;span style="text-align: justify;"&gt;"Professor: a hacker way of being". "Everything is changing and we have seen this with all the world protests, including Brazil", he said, as one of the highlights of the first day of Fisl14. Education, to him, is undergoing very&lt;/span&gt; important moments of transformation. This change is due to the dedicated work of the professor. "Our work is hard. The challenge is the connectivity - that is everywhere and demands much more from us".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The focus of the educator has to be in the need to become a hacker. "Not only a hacker from the view point of programming, but also information sharing, decentralization and technology", he says. For the teacher, sharing is not enough. "This is meaningful only if it yields results, concrete facts and public policies that satisfy societal demands", according to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Another debated issue was the "hacker ethics", that has generosity as one of the main pillars. "We need to think this process in every field. We need a society that is open in data, information and access". About the challenges for education, Pretto is very objective. "Education is like a funnel, that transforms the other person in myself. What schools are really lacking is creating bottle openers with sticks and amplifiers with pet bottles", he says, about craftman's creation, ideas and innovation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For all this to happen it is necessary a few important tools. "An education network can only change with Free Software, open programs for education, besides an activists teacher, empowered and hacker in his/her way of being", he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executive Director and co-founder of Ada Initiative - a foundation that gathers thousands of women in tech and culture - Valérie Aurora opened the second day of the Forum speaking about the importance of women in Free Software conferences. "I attend many events and I can assure you female attendance is almost null, like 2%, and this absence has a serious reason: harassment".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Aurora, Fisl is playing an important role at combatting this problem. "At Fisl' website one can find an anti-harassment policy which tells people the kinds of behaviour that are acceptable, what is not allowed, and the sanctions applicable to those who violate it".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Politics, according to Gabriel Galli, who works at the Forum's press team, whishes to provide an experience free from harassment to all participants, regardless of genera, special needs, sex orientation, physical appearance, race, etnicity, religion or economic condition. "We, members of the organization tem and of the Free Software community cannot allow any form of disrespect to the participants. Here everybody will always be received warmly", says Galli.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aurora provided data about women participation in Free Software conferences, and quoted Brazil as a promising country. "45% of participants in events happening in Malaysia are women. In USA it is 40%. In Brazil female participation drops to 10%". However, that number may increase easily. "Fisl is an example to all of us. Half of all speakers here are women. Besides, they are protected by the anti-harassment policy. This encourages their participation".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Protests in the Brazilian streets were also mentioned by the speaker, who stressed the vast female presence. "Imagine if all these women would stay home instead of going out to protest?" Aurora says intelligence and female kindness make all the difference in the struggle for the whole community of Free Software.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When speaking about the future of conferences, Aurora leaves her message. "Don't tolerate, allow or encourage sexual harassment. Be careful when interpreting a woman", she completed, when talking about precipitated conclusions from men about female sympathy. "We need to make eye contact when talking, this doesn't mean that we're flirting".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Foto: Tárlis Schneider/Indicefoto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;In the video, the Install Fest promoted by the Software Livre.Org Association in the first edition of Conexões Globais.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;From Thursday to Saturday (May, 23 to 25), the Casa de Cultura Mario Quintana, in Porto Alegre, will host the second edition of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.conexoesglobais.com.br" title="Site Conexões Globais" target="_blank"&gt;Conexões Globais&lt;/a&gt;, an event that bridges conferences with free culture and democracy 2.0 activists to&lt;/span&gt; educational and cultural activities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During three days, major digital culture thinkers and activists from many countries will be gathered - either physically and remotely - around themes such as democracy in the 21st century, new technologies, education, right to communication, internet freedom and new ways to mobilize, among other discussions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ronaldo Lemos (Overmundo website creator and Creative Commons Brasil coordinator), Natália Viana (Agência Pública de Jornalismo founder), Peter Sunde (The Pirate Bay Founder), Javier Toret (cyberactivist, spanish movement 15M), Gustavo Anitelli (producer of the band O Teatro Mágico and Movement MPB - Música Para Baixar) are among the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.conexoesglobais.com.br/debatedores/" title="Debatedores Conexões Globais" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;confirmed names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The programme also has shows and workshops.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FISL couldn't be absent to an event built collaboratively. Besides participation in the collaborative press coverage, with participation of the Free Software Radio as the Official Radio, the communication team will offer workshops about &lt;strong&gt;Video Editing&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Banners Creation&lt;/strong&gt;, with Free Software. But collaboration does not stop there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Our meeting point is the Install Fest&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;From&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; 2:00PM to 6:00PM, May, 24 and 25, Rodrigo Troian, Coordinator of FISL Programme Workgroup, will be hosting, together with educator Paulo Bertazzo and other activists, an &lt;strong&gt;Install Fest&lt;/strong&gt;. For those unfamiliar, the GNU/Linux operating systems installation festivals are a tradition in the community. In these informal meetings, advanced GNU/Linux users offer orientation about using open and free operating systems, and also installation of free OS and programs in personal computers. It is even possible to install a GNU/Linux system just for trial, without removing previous systems in the machine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The event will happen at the Jardim Lutzemberg, CCMQ's 5th floor, and those in town can't loose it! It is open to curious people, begginers and intermediate level users - and also for those wishing to better understand what it is all about Free Software - the Install Fest will be a preview for the largest Free Software community meeting in the galaxy, that will happen July, from 3 to 6 at the PUCRS Center of Events. Don't even need to say which one is it, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 13:29:02 +0000</pubDate><link>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl14/blog/fisl-preview-at-the-conexoes-globais</link><guid>http://softwarelivre.org/fisl14/blog/fisl-preview-at-the-conexoes-globais</guid></item><item><title>"Free Talk" show airs at Free Software Radio</title><description>&lt;p style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif, 'Liberation Sans', Arial; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;img src="/articles/0125/6398/dsc-0291.jpg" alt="" style="height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="500"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bitchwhocodes"&gt;Stacey Mulcahy&lt;/a&gt; Originally posted at: &lt;a href="http://futurewomanintech.com/"&gt;Future Woman In Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up to my niece's phone call today. She had called to tell me that she finally had an answer to that fateful forever question of "what do you want to be when you grow up". She wanted to make video games. This didn’t really surprise me - she always had a knack for summarizing complex game play in a few words. What did surprise me, however, was my inability to go back to sleep after that call. I lay awake, thinking about her future career choice, about how things are now, and how much I wish I could change them for her. I got up, and I wrote her this letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="begin"&gt;Dear niece - on your 8th birthday,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="address"&gt;As a future woman in technology, I want so much more for you than I can articulate. Hopefully, things will have seen some change when you are ready to make this world your own. If that is not the case, here is what I wish for you, for every young woman, and for this industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item2"&gt;I hope that if someone chooses to toss an adjective in front of your job title, that it is about your qualifications - not your gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item3"&gt;I hope that you never have to develop a "thick skin". You are sensitive and thoughtful and lovely - cost of entry should not include compromising who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item4"&gt;I hope that you never understand the terms "boys club" and "sausage party" and mostly, that you never find yourself using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item5"&gt;I hope that being a female developer will cease to be a novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item6"&gt;I hope that you attend conferences and find yourself complaining about long lines for the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item7"&gt;I hope that you never have to see that look of shock when you tell someone you are a developer. Mostly, I hope you never have to hear someone say "good for you".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item8"&gt;I hope that when you attend a meeting that is mostly male, that you never get asked why you are not taking meeting notes. I hope you say "fuck this" more than "it's okay".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item9"&gt;I hope that you will speak about your expertise. And that when you do, people won’t use some form of social media to point out your body issues. The only body on display, is your body of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item10"&gt;I hope that skill will always be held in higher esteem than your gender - if you had no skill, you would not be part of the discussion, and your gender is simply a modifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item11"&gt;I hope that when you ask for what you want and work hard to get it, ambition won’t be misplaced for aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item12"&gt;I hope that when you say what you think, you will be considered a contributor, and not a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item13"&gt;I hope that no one ever tells you to "deal with it", "relax", or "ease up" because you refuse to laugh at something that simply is not funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item14"&gt;I hope that your initial interactions involve an immediate transfer of trust in your abilities, rather than starting off by always having to prove yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item15"&gt;I hope that you never have to fight for equal pay. And if you do, I hope that you never feel like you need to disparage another for what is rightfully yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item16"&gt;I hope that you never have to hear a co-worker disservice a colleague by describing their physicality before their competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item17"&gt;I hope that you find yourself as lucky as I, working with people who are respectful, encouraging and inspiring. Find people who want to raise you up, rather than keep you down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="honey"&gt;I hope that you embrace your own inner honey badger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item18"&gt;There will be generous, supportive people in your industry. May you have the good fortune to make those connections and hold them close. They will define you in ways that you could not imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="item19"&gt;Passion is infectious. I hope you allow yourself to be inspired, but to also inspire. Your work will speak for itself, if you let it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/articles/0124/8897/grade13.png" alt="" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about having your name at Fisl14' grid?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The deadline for submission of speeches proposals, workshops and activities closed yesterday, April, 8. But those who couldn't send their proposal have one more chance: we'll be receiving proposals up to the 28th, through the &lt;a href="http://fisl.org.br/14/papers_ng/" title="Inscreva sua palestra!"&gt;Papers System&lt;/a&gt;.
